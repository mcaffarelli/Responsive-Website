# Responsive-Website

This is a responsive website that is promoting my girlfriendâ€™s business, Flour Pedal. The business and it's website are still in very early stages of development, but this website is something I developed to help promote it. Being in early stages, the buisness aspects are a rough draft. However, the website desplays skills including resonsive design, HTML, CSS, and PHP. Included is a form where a user can input their information and send an email to the buisness owner via the submit button. 

You can visit the website here:  http://flourpedalcafe.com/
