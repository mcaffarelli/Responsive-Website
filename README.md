# Responsive-Website

This is a responsive website that is promoting my girlfriendâ€™s business Flour Pedal. The business is still in very early stages of development, but this website is something I developed to help promote it. We are still currently in the process of updating many different aspects of the website, but this is the current format. The website is responsive and has a form at the bottom where the user can input their information and send us a message via email. 

You can visit the website here:  http://flourpedalcafe.com/
